I am a research software engineer at **UCL's Centre for Advanced Research Computing**, where I am partly funded by grants from **[EPCC](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk)** (GPU embedded Computational Science and Engineering grant) and **[UKSA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-space-agency)** (Euclid grant) to work on **[GLASS](https://github.com/glass-dev/glass)**. Besides writing code, I also tutor for scientific computing courses and workshops at UCL and other places (**[/teaching](/teaching)**). I graduated from the **University of Delhi (department rank 2)** with a major in Computer Science and Mathematics in 2024 (with a thesis titled "*Computational upgrades to the high energy physics analysis pipeline for future LHC/HL-LHC runs*"). My thesis was carried out at **CERN**, under the **Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering (PICSciE)**.  Moreover, in daylight, I work on my academic and professional commitments, and by night, I develop and maintain open-source scientific software (**[/opensource](/opensource)**), which I believe are the key to collaborative and reproducible research.

I worked as a visiting student researcher (**[Mitacs GRI](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship)**) under Prof. Jacques Carette at **McMaster University** in the summer of 2023. My work here revolved around Type Theory, Proof Theory, Functional Programming, Logic, **[agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php){:target="_blank"}**, and **[agda-stdlib](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib){:target="_blank"}**. Before this, I was a research fellow at **Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP), Princeton University** under Dr. Henry Schreiner and Dr. Jim Pivarski where my work involved developing a library for JIT-compilable ragged Lorentz vector manipulations (**[/experiences](/experiences)** for other work-related stuff).


I am interested in blending **programming languages** and **high-performance computing** for **data-intensive computational science**. I am extremely passionate about **open-source** and **open-science**, and I actively volunteer for several open-source programs and initiatives. Finally, I possess a strong background in **android and backend development** and traditional **software engineering**, but I don't find them interesting anymore.

<!-- Apart from academics, you might find me reading popular science books, riding my bicycle (every day at 5 pm), stargazing and photographing eclipses using my 5-7 year old telescopes, and trying to learn how to play a violin. -->
