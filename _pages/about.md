I am an engineering sophomore at **[Cluster Innovation Center](http://cic.du.ac.in/)**, **[University of Delhi](http://du.ac.in/)**, pursuing a major in Information Technology and Mathematics. In daylight, I work towards my academic skills and professional commitments, and by night, I develop and maintain open-source research software, which I believe are the key to collaborative and reproducible research.

Currently, I am a **[fellow](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/Saransh-cpp.html)** at the **[Analysis Systems](https://iris-hep.org/as.html)** group of **[Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)](https://iris-hep.org/)**, where I am working on the first-ever major release of **[Vector](https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector)** under **[Dr. Henry Schreiner](https://iscinumpy.gitlab.io/page/about/)** and **[Dr. Jim Pivarski](https://github.com/jpivarski)**. I am also working as a technical writer for **[FluxML](https://fluxml.ai/)** under **[Julia Season of Contributions](https://julialang.org/jsoc/)**. I am interested in everything a **[Research Software Engineer](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/)** and a **Machine Learning Engineer** do! I am passionate about **Scientific Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **developing packages**, **code optimization**, **technical writing**, **building infrastructures** and **CI/CD pipelines**, **developing and advocating open-source research software**, **JuliaLang**, and **Python**. Psst, I was previously interested in Android and backend development, and though I still remember most of them, I have moved on.

I have previously worked as a **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)** student developer under **[PyBaMM](https://www.pybamm.org/)** (Python Battery Mathematical Modeling), **[NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/)**, where **[Dr. Valentin Sulzer](https://sites.google.com/view/valentinsulzer)**, **[Dr. Ferran Brosa Planela](https://www.brosaplanella.com/)**, and **[Dr. Robert Timms](https://www.robertwtimms.com/)** mentored me. My work was centered around creating a Twitter bot (**[BattBot](https://github.com/pybamm-team/BattBot)**, thanks to a fun Twitter poll) capable of running mathematical simulations of batteries, both automatically and on request. Currently, I am involved in the development and maintenance of **[PyBaMM](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM)**, **[BattBot](https://github.com/pybamm-team/BattBot)**, and **[liionpack](https://github.com/pybamm-team/liionpack)**. My minor contributions are scattered across various research software, including **[DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde)**, **[Colour](https://github.com/colour-science/colour)**, and **[JuliaLang](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia)**!
