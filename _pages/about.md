I am an engineering junior at **[Cluster Innovation Center](http://cic.du.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}**, **[University of Delhi](http://du.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}**, pursuing a major in Information Technology and Mathematics. In daylight, I work towards my academic skills and professional commitments, and by night, I develop and maintain open-source research software, which I believe are the key to collaborative and reproducible research.

Currently, I am working as an open-source developer and a technical writer for **[FluxML](https://fluxml.ai/){:target="_blank"}**, which is being funded by the **[Julia Language](https://julialang.org/){:target="_blank"}**. In the summer of 2022, I worked as a **[research fellow](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/Saransh-cpp.html){:target="_blank"}** at the **[Analysis Systems](https://iris-hep.org/as.html){:target="_blank"}** group of **[Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](https://iris-hep.org/){:target="_blank"}**, **[Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/)**. My work here revolved around **[Vector](https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector){:target="_blank"}**, a Python library for creating and manipulating High Energy Physics vectors. In the summer of 2021, I worked as a **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/){:target="_blank"}** student developer under **[PyBaMM](https://www.pybamm.org/){:target="_blank"}** (Python Battery Mathematical Modeling), **[NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/){:target="_blank"}**. My work here revolved around, yes you guessed it right, Mathematical Modeling of Batteries in Python.

I primarily contribute to (and in some cases maintain) the **[PyBaMM ecosystem](https://github.com/pybamm-team/){:target="_blank"}**, **[Scikit-HEP/vector](https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector){:target="_blank"}** (and **[some surronding packages](https://github.com/scikit-hep){:target="_blank"}**), **[Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl){:target="_blank"}** (and **[some surronding packages](https://github.com/FluxML){:target="_blank"}**), and random Open-Source Research Software. My minor contributions to Open-Source Research Software are scattered all across GitHub (from the **[Scikit-HEP ecosystem](https://github.com/scikit-hep/){:target="_blank"}**, **[Zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python){:target="_blank"}**, to **[Colour](https://github.com/colour-science/colour){:target="_blank"}** and **[Scikits.odes](https://github.com/bmcage/odes){:target="_blank"}**).

I am interested in everything a **[Research Software Engineer](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/){:target="_blank"}** and a **Machine Learning Engineer** do! I am passionate about **Scientific Machine Learning**, **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Technical Writing**, **building infrastructures**, **CI/CD pipelines**, **developing and advocating Open-Source Research Software**, **JuliaLang**, and **Python**. Psst, I was previously interested in Android and backend development, and though I still remember most of them, I have moved on.
