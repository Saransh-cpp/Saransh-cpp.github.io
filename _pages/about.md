I am Saransh, an undergraduate sophomore at [Cluster Innovation Center](), [University of Delhi](), pursuing a major in Information Technology and Mathematics. In daylight, I work towards my academic skills and professional commitments, and by night, I develop and maintain open-source research software, which I believe is the key to collaborative and reproducible research.

Currently, I am a [fellow]() at the [Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)](), where I am working on the first-ever major release of [Vector]() under [Dr. Henry Schreiner]() and [Dr. Jim Pivarski](). I am also working as a technical writer for [FluxML]() under [Julia Season of Contributions](). I am interested in everything a **[Research Software Engineer]()** and a **Machine Learning Engineer** do! My interests include **Scientific Machine Learning**, **developing packages**, **code optimization**, **technical writing**, **building infrastructures** and **CI/CD pipelines**, **developing and advocating open-source research software**, **JuliaLang**, and **Python**. Psst, I was previously interested in Android and backend development, and though I still remember most of them, I have moved on.

I have previously worked as a [Google Summer of Code]() student developer under [PyBaMM]() (Python Battery Mathematical Modeling), [NumFOCUS](), where [Dr. Valentin Sulzer](), [Dr. Ferran Brosa Planela](), and [Dr. Robert Timms]() mentored me. My work was centered around creating a Twitter bot ([BattBot](), thanks to a fun [Twitter poll]()) capable of running mathematical simulations of batteries, both automatically and on request. Currently, I am involved in the development and maintenance of [PyBaMM]() and [BattBot](), and some of my major contributions are visible in [liionpack](), [FluxML](), and [Vector](). My minor contributions are spread across various research software, including [DeepXDE](), [Colour](), [sktime](), and [JuliaLang]()!
