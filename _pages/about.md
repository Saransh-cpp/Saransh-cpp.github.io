I am an engineering junior at **[Cluster Innovation Center](http://cic.du.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}**, **[University of Delhi](http://du.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}**, pursuing a major in Information Technology and Mathematics. In daylight, I work towards my academic skills and professional commitments, and by night, I develop and maintain open-source research software, which I believe are the key to collaborative and reproducible research.

Currently, I am working as an open-source developer and a technical writer at **[FluxML](https://fluxml.ai/){:target="_blank"}**, which is being funded by the **[Julia Language](https://julialang.org/){:target="_blank"}**. I have previously worked as a **[research fellow](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/Saransh-cpp.html){:target="_blank"}** at the **[Analysis Systems](https://iris-hep.org/as.html){:target="_blank"}** group of **[Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](https://iris-hep.org/){:target="_blank"}**, **[Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/)**. My work at **[IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org/)**, under the mentorship of **[Dr. Henry Schreiner](https://iscinumpy.gitlab.io/page/about/){:target="_blank"}** and **[Dr. Jim Pivarski](https://github.com/jpivarski){:target="_blank"}**, revolved around developing the first-ever major release of **[Vector](https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector){:target="_blank"}**. I am interested in everything a **[Research Software Engineer](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/){:target="_blank"}** and a **Machine Learning Engineer** do! I am passionate about **Scientific Machine Learning**, **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **developing packages**, **code optimizations**, **technical writing**, **building infrastructures** and **CI/CD pipelines**, **developing and advocating open-source research software**, **JuliaLang**, and **Python**. Psst, I was previously interested in Android and backend development, and though I still remember most of them, I have moved on.

I have also previously worked as a **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/){:target="_blank"}** student developer under **[PyBaMM](https://www.pybamm.org/){:target="_blank"}** (Python Battery Mathematical Modeling), **[NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/){:target="_blank"}**, where **[Dr. Valentin Sulzer](https://sites.google.com/view/valentinsulzer){:target="_blank"}**, **[Dr. Ferran Brosa Planela](https://www.brosaplanella.com/){:target="_blank"}**, and **[Dr. Robert Timms](https://www.robertwtimms.com/){:target="_blank"}** mentored me. Currently, I am involved with the development (and in some cases maintenance) of **[Vector (High-Energy-Physics vectors)](https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector){:target="_blank"}**, **[FluxML (Julia's primary ML and DL ecosystem)](https://github.com/FluxML/){:target="_blank"}**, **[PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modeling)](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM){:target="_blank"}**, **[BattBot (Battery Bot)](https://github.com/pybamm-team/BattBot){:target="_blank"}**, **[liionpack (Battery pack simulation tool)](https://github.com/pybamm-team/liionpack){:target="_blank"}**, and my minor contributions to Open-Source Scientific Software are scattered all across GitHub (from the **[Scikit-HEP ecosystem](https://github.com/scikit-hep/){:target="_blank"}**, **[DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde){:target="_blank"}**, to **[Colour](https://github.com/colour-science/colour){:target="_blank"}** and **[Scikits.odes](https://github.com/bmcage/odes){:target="_blank"}**).
