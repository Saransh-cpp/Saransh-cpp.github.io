I am a master's (computational science and engineering) student at **EPFL** (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne / Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne). At the moment, I am interning with the Cognitive AI team at **Logitech**, Switzerland.

Before joining EPFL, I was a research software engineer at **UCL's Advanced Research Computing Centre**, where I worked on HPC and DevOps projects. Even before UCL, I worked as a research software engineer at **CERN** (under the **Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering**), writing software for computational high-energy physics. I hold an undergraduate degree in computer science and mathematics from the **University of Delhi**. Besides writing code, I am also quite fond of teaching courses and workshops, broadly on scientific and high-performance computing, software engineering, and numerical mathematics (**[/teaching](/teaching)**).

Apart from the experiences above, I have also dabbled with functional programming and type theory, more computational high-energy physics and numerical mathematics, applied machine learning (for science and social good), technical writing for ML frameworks, and mathematical modeling of batteries (**[/experiences](/experiences)**). Moreover, I develop and maintain different parts (infrastructure, developer tooling, code, docs, ...) of several open-source scientific software (**[/opensource](/opensource)**).

I am specifically interested in **Computational Mathematics** (Numerical Methods, Type and Proof Theory, Automatic Differentiation), **Scientific Computing** (High-Performance Computing, Data-Intensive Computational Methods, DevOps), and **Applied Machine Learning** (for Science, social good, and more). I advocate for and am extremely passionate about **open-source** and **open-science**.
