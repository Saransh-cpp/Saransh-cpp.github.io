Below are my "formal" work experiences and educational qualifications. I also contribute to several open-source scientific software, and I consider that as an "experience" too (see **[/opensource](/opensource)**). I have also mentored several students and researchers who are new at writing code for research/scientific software (see **[/teaching](/teaching)**). Finally, programming can be learnt without any formal degrees; hence, my skills/abilities are not limited by my courses.
