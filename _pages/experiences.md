Below are my "formal" work experiences. I also contribute to several open-source scientific software, and I consider that as an "experience" too (see **[/opensource](/opensource)**). I have also mentored several students and researchers who are new at writing code for research/scientific software (see **[/teaching](/teaching)**).

###### June 2022 - September 2022 | Remote

<!-- - Work: -->
- Co-authored a Python-based Lorentz vector manipulation library with support for ragged data and JIT compilation.
- Worked on Scientific Python's developer guides and tools, and fixed bugs in the Scikit-HEP ecosystem.

<!-- - Impact:
  - Vector has **50+ GitHub stars** and **210,000+ installs**.
  - The releases are currently being used by researchers at **CERN**, **Princeton University**, **IRIS-HEP** and **other research institutes**. -->

<!-- - Positions of responsibility, volunteering, talks:
  - Joined vector's GitHub repository and Conda Feedstock as a maintainer.
  - Presented my work and vector at **21st International Workshop on Advanced Computing and Analysis Techniques in Physics Research**, **5th International Workshop on Python in High Energy Physics**, and multiple **IRIS-HEP**, **Princeton Research Computing** meetups (see **[/talks](/talks){:target="_blank"}**).
  - Invited to join **PyHEP 2023.dev** (first PyHEP developers meetup) at Princeton, but won't be able to make it üò¢
  - I still maintain/contribute to vector! -->

##### [Technical Writer and Open-Source Developer](https://julialang.org/jsoc/){:target="_blank"}
###### Mr. Dhairya Gandhi (Julia Computing / JuliaHub)
###### May 2022 - October 2022 | Remote (Part-Time)

<!-- - Work: -->
<!-- - Developed the documentation + packaging infrastructure and fixed bugs in FluxML, an ML and DL ecosystem that provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia‚Äôs native GPU and AD support.
- Wrote original Machine Learning/Deep Learning tutorials, documentation and API references for FluxML's ecosystem. -->

<!-- - Impact:
  - FluxML is Julia's primary ML and DL ecosystem with hundreds of thousands of downloads.
  - Flux.jl alone has **4000+ GitHub stars** and **110,000+ installs** (Julia-n ecosystems are not concentrated in a single library - for instance, there is a separate package under FluxML just for one-hot encoding - OneHotArrays.jl).
  - The documentation, infrastructue, and bug fixes impacted ML and DL researchers all around the world, including institutions and companies (MIT, AMD, UCL, CMU, and so on). -->

<!-- - Recognition, talks, and more:
  - Joined FluxML's GitHub organisation.
  - Will be presenting my work at **JuliaCon 2023** (see **[/talks](/talks){:target="_blank"}**).
  - My work was shared on FluxML's and JuliaLang's official **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/FluxML/status/1589255265559396352)** and **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6995034692412456960/)** accounts.
