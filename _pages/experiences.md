Below are my "formal" work experiences. I also contribute to several Open-Source Scientific Software, and I consider that as an "experience" too (see **[/opensource](/opensource)**). I have also mentored several students and researchers who are new at writing code for research/scientific software (see **[/supervise](/supervise)**).

###### Prof. Jacques Carette
###### June - August 2023 | Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

- Worked Type Theory, Functional Programming, and Computational Logic to formalize Mathematics and Computing in [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php)â€™s (a dependently typed functional programming language and an interactive theorem prover) standard library using Type Theory, Proof Theory, Functional Programming, and Computational Logic.
- Refactored the standard library's codebase for v2.0, simplified the dependency graph, fixed various bugs, and added new functions and mathematical proofs.

###### June - September 2022 | Remote

- Work:
  - Directly responsible for preparing **[vector](https://vector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){:target="_blank"}**, a Python library for constructing Just-In-Time compilable jagged Lorentz vectors, for **v0.9.0**, **v0.10.0**, **v0.11.0** and **v1.0.0** (first major release).
  - Worked closely with researchers from **CERN**, **IRIS-HEP ([Analysis Systems group](https://iris-hep.org){:target="_blank"})**, and **Princeton ([Princeton Research Computing group](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu){:target="_blank"})** to develop new API, fix bugs, and build infrastructures for the HEP ecosystem.
<!-- - Impact:
  - Vector has **50+ GitHub stars** and **210,000+ installs**.
  - The releases are currently being used by researchers at **CERN**, **Princeton University**, **IRIS-HEP** and **other research institutes**. -->

- Positions of responsibility, volunteering, talks:
  - Joined vector's GitHub repository and Conda Feedstock as a maintainer.
  - Presented my work and vector at **21st International Workshop on Advanced Computing and Analysis Techniques in Physics Research**, **5th International Workshop on Python in High Energy Physics**, and multiple **IRIS-HEP**, **Princeton Research Computing** meetups (see **[/talks](/talks){:target="_blank"}**).
  - Invited to join **PyHEP 2023.dev** (first PyHEP developers meetup) at Princeton, but won't be able to make it ðŸ˜¢
  - I still maintain/contribute to vector!

###### Mr. Dhairya Gandhi (Julia Computing / JuliaHub)
###### May - October 2022 | Remote (Part-Time)

- Work:
  - Developed the documentation + packaging infrastructure and fixed bugs in FluxML, an ML and DL ecosystem that provides lightweight abstractions on top of Juliaâ€™s native GPU and AD support.
   - Wrote original Machine Learning/Deep Learning tutorials, documentation and API references for FluxML's ecosystem.
<!-- - Impact:
  - FluxML is Julia's primary ML and DL ecosystem with hundreds of thousands of downloads.
  - Flux.jl alone has **4000+ GitHub stars** and **110,000+ installs** (Julia-n ecosystems are not concentrated in a single library - for instance, there is a separate package under FluxML just for one-hot encoding - OneHotArrays.jl).
  - The documentation, infrastructue, and bug fixes impacted ML and DL researchers all around the world, including institutions and companies (MIT, AMD, UCL, CMU, and so on). -->

- Recognition, talks, and more:
  - Joined FluxML's GitHub organisation.
  - Will be presenting my work at **JuliaCon 2023** (see **[/talks](/talks){:target="_blank"}**).
  - My work was shared on FluxML's and JuliaLang's official **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/FluxML/status/1589255265559396352)** and **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6995034692412456960/)** accounts.
  - I still contribute to FluxML!

- Work:
  - Built an novel Twitter Bot ([BattBot](https://github.com/pybamm-team/BattBot)) capable of automatically constructing Mathematical Simulations of Batteries.
  - Developed new API, fixed bugs, and created new documentation for the PyBaMM ecosystem.
  - Created multiple build and packaging infrastructures for the PyBaMM ecosystem and the upstream packages.
<!-- - Impact:
  - PyBaMM is a collaboration between multiple academic institutes with **550+ GitHub stars** and **300,000+ installs**.
  - My work impacted battery researchers worldwide as PyBaMM is the most adopted Python framework for Modeling of Batteries.
  - BattBot gained a lot of traction on Twitter and GitHub. -->

- Positions of responsibility, volunteering, talks:
  - I regularly supervise PyBaMM's GSoC projects.
  - Joined PyBaMM's GitHub organisation as a maintainer.
  - Presented my work at [PyBaMM's first training workshop](https://www.pybamm.org/training) and GSoC showcase.
  - Invited to join [PyBaMM's steering council](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/wiki/Governance#current-steering-council) (associated with NumFOCUS).
  - Joined [liionpack](https://github.com/pybamm-team/liionpack) as a core-developer.
  - I still maintain PyBaMM, liionpack, and BattBot!
