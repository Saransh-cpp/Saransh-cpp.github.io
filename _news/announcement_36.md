At UCL, I am now partly funded by the **[GPU embedded Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/)** grant from the **[Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk)** to implement GPU and autodiff support for **[GLASS](https://glass.readthedocs.io/stable/)** (Generator for Large Scale Structure).
