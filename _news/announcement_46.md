I have joined **[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne - EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch){:target="_blank"}** as a master's (computational science end engineering) student!!! This also means that I am no longer a research software engineer at **[UCL's Advanced Research Computing Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/arc){:target="_blank"}** :(
