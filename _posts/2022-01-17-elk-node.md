Elasticsearch is a relatively new and open-source search engine available for use to anyone in the world! It is blazingly fast and is surprisingly written in java! It uses the JSON format to store data that can be accessed by various HTTP methods. The service is also scalable, making it a perfect choice for big tech companies. Currently, companies like Uber, Netflix, Slack, and Microsoft use Elasticsearch to integrate searching functionality into their products. Elasticsearch recently changed its open-source license which resulted in Amazon releasing OpenSearch, a search engine created by forking Elasticsearch.

> Elasticsearch uses something called an index to store all the information. Quoting the documentation -
> 
> An index is like a ‘database’ in a relational database. It has a mapping which defines multiple types.
> The easiest and most familiar layout clones what you would expect from a relational database. You can (very roughly) think of an index like a database.
> 
> MySQL => Databases => Tables => Columns/Rows
> Elasticsearch => Indices => Types => Documents with Properties
> 
> An Elasticsearch cluster can contain multiple Indices (databases), which in turn contain multiple Types (tables). These types hold multiple Documents (rows), and each document has Properties(columns).

Summarising the documentation, we need an index to store any kind of data in Elasticsearch. There can be multiple indeces, which can then store different data.

Additionally, Elasticsearch also comes with a family of other products which seamlessly integrate with it. The original members of this family were Logstash and Kibana, together creating the famous ELK stack!

In 2015, Elastic came up with a new family member called Beats, but unfortunately, this new stack has no official name :( We won’t be covering these family members in this article, but we might touch on kibana at the end ;)

## Firing up Elasticsearch (locally)

<p align="center">

</p>

Let us begin by firing up Elasticsearch locally, using our classic command prompt -
1. Install Elasticsearch if you haven’t already from [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).
2. Navigate to the downloaded file and unzip it if required.
3. Fire up your command prompt or terminal in the downloaded file and launch the Elasticsearch service by running bin/elasticsearch.

The service will start running on http://localhost:9200/ or on a port mentioned in your command prompt/terminal!

## A new node.js project

</p>

We can now create a new node.js project to code out our server -

1. Create a new empty folder. I will be naming it node_elastic.
2. Run npm init and select your configurations. I will be putting my entry point as server.js instead of the default index.js.
3. This will create a package.json file in your current directory. In my case, the package.json file looks like this -

{% highlight json linenos %}
 {
   "name": "node_elastic",
   "version": "1.0.0",
   "description": "Scraping and ingesting Reddit memes into Elasticsearch using node.js",
   "main": "server.js",
   "scripts": {
     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
   },
   "author": "Saransh-cpp",
   "license": "ISC"
 }
{% endhighlight %}

As a final step, let us add a new script to make the development process a bit smoother -

{% highlight terminal %}
"start": "node server.js"
{% endhighlight %}

The complete json file now -

{% highlight json linenos %}
 {
   "name": "node_elastic",
   "version": "1.0.0",
   "description": "Scraping and ingesting Reddit memes into Elasticsearch using node.js",
   "main": "server.js",
   "scripts": {
     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
     "start": "node server.js"
   },
   "author": "Saransh-cpp",
   "license": "ISC"
 }
{% endhighlight %}
